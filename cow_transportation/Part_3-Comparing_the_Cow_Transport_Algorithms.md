# Part 3: Compare the Algorithms

POLL: ALGORITHM INTUITION  
(ungraded) Before doing the task in this part, answer the following question to see your intuition for how the greedy and brute force algorithm run. In terms of time, which algorithm do you expect will run faster?

RESULTS  
Greedy Algorithm 94%  
Brute Force Algorithm 6%  
Results gathered from 1258 respondents.

## Part 3: Compare the Algorithms
Implement `compare_cow_transport_algorithms`. Load the cow data in _ps1_cow_data.txt_, and then run your greedy and brute force cow transport algorithms on the data to find the minimum number of trips found by each algorithm and how long each method takes. Use the default weight limits of 10 for both algorithms. Make sure youâ€™ve tested both your greedy and brute force algorithms before you implement this!

### Hints:
* You can measure the time a block of code takes to execute using the `time.time()` function as follows. This prints the duration in seconds, as a float. For a very small fraction of a second, it will print 0.0.
```python
start = time.time()
## code to be timed
end = time.time()
print(end - start)
```
* Using the given default weight limits of 10 and the given cow data, both algorithms should not take more than a few seconds to run.

#### Part 3-1
2.0/2.0 points (graded)  
Now that you have run your benchmarks, which algorithm runs faster?  
The Greedy Transport Algorithm correct

#### Part 3-2
2.0/2.0 points (graded)  
Consider the properties of the GREEDY algorithm. Will it return the optimal solution?  
It could, but it depends on the data, not always. correct

#### Part 3-3
2.0/2.0 points (graded)  
Consider the properties of the BRUTE FORCE algorithm. Will it return the optimal solution?  
Yes, all the time correct
